## News

-   05/30/2024. The new version (v3.0) of Slurm Simulation is out. It is based on Slurm 23.02. The goal of the new version is to be sufficiently fast and reasonably accurate. See Figure 1 for comparison of Slurm simulator results with unmodified Slurm run.
    -   To run Slurm Simulator user docker container [nsimakov/slurm_sim:v3.0](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nsimakov/slurm_sim/general).
    -   See [tutorials](tutorials/) on how to run it.
    -   Use [v3.0-branch](https://github.com/ubccr-slurm-simulator/slurm_sim_tools/tree/v3.0-branch) for the toolkit and [slurm-23-02-sim branch](https://github.com/ubccr-slurm-simulator/slurm_simulator/tree/slurm-23-02-sim) for Slurm simulator. Use

## Overview

Slurm is an open source job scheduling system that is widely used in many small and large-scale HPC resources, including almost all current [ACCESS](https://access-ci.org/) resources. Like all resource management programs, Slurm is highly tunable, with many parametric settings that can significantly influence job throughput, overall system utilization and job wait times. Unfortunately, in many cases it is difficult to judge how modification of these parameters will affect the overall performance of the HPC resource. For example, a given policy choice which changes a single Slurm parameter may have unintended and perhaps undesirable consequences for the overall performance of the HPC system. Also, it may take days or even weeks to see what, if any, impact certain changes have on the scheduler performance and operation. For these reasons, attempting to tune system performance or implement new policy choices through changes in the Slurm parameters on a production HPC system is not practical. In a real sense, HPC center personnel are often times operating in the dark with respect to tuning the Slurm parameter space to optimize job throughput or resource efficiency. The ability to simulate a Slurm operating environment can therefore provide a means to improve an existing production system or predict the performance of a newly planned HPC system, without impacting the production instance of Slurm

We have developed a standalone Slurm Simulator, which runs on a workstation or a single HPC node, that allows time accelerated simulation of workloads on HPC resources. Based on a modification of the actual Slurm code, the simulator can be used to study the effects of different Slurm parameters on HPC resource performance and to optimize these parameters to fit a particular need or policy, for example, maximizing throughput for a particular range of job sizes. In the current implementation, the Slurm simulator can model historic or synthetic workloads of a single cluster. For small clusters, the simulator can simulate as many as 17 days per hour depending on the job composition, and the Slurm configuration.
