# Slurm Simulator: Micro Cluster Tutorial

In this exercise the idea is to check how different priorities affect wait time

Check following files in etc directory:
```
sacctmgr_nopriority.script
sacctmgr_priority100.script
sacctmgr_priority200.script
```
Notice that they have different priorities for QoS

### Adopting the Slurm Configuration for Simulation

The simulator is built from Slurm code and uses regular Slurm configuration.

In `etc` directory you can find several Slurm configuration files that were used in Virtual Clusters (actual unmodified Slurm installation where each compute node is represented as docker container).

First, we need to modify it for the simulation purposes.

The Slurm configuration files:
* `slurm.conf`
* `topology.conf`
* `gres.conf`
* `slurmdbd.conf`
